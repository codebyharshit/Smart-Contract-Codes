# Smart-Contract-Codes
Topic 
Make a smart contract to add token to different slabs. 


Requirements 
1. Define 5 slabs with capacity for each [say Slab0â€¦.Slab4 having 100,200,300,400 and  500 as capacity] 
2. When a ERC20 token of specific type is deposited, it occupies the highest level and if  the capacity reaches the maximum, it goes to the next lower level 
3. When the depositor enquires, it states which slab the deposit is. 


Non-Functional Features to Incorporate 
1. Minimal gas to be spend 
2. Unit Testing for a robust system.
